# Sales-Data-Management-System
This program allows users to input sales data for multiple salespeople and products, calculates the total sales for each salesperson and each product, and displays the results in tabular form. The program uses a 2D array to store the sales data and includes methods to calculate totals for individual salespeople and products.

# How it works:
1. The program prompts the user to enter the number of salespeople and the number of products.
2. If the number of salespeople is less than or equal to 5 and the number of products is less than or equal to 4, the program proceeds to input sales data.
3. The program uses a 2D array to store sales data where each row represents a salesperson, and each column represents a product.
4. The total sales for each salesperson and each product are calculated using helper methods.
5. The program then prints the total sales for each salesperson and each product in a tabular format.
